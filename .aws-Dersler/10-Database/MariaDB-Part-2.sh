# Part 2 - Connecting and Configuring MariaDB Database

# Connect to the MariaDB Server and open MySQL CLI with root user, no password set as default.



# Show default databases in the MariaDB Server.

# Show tables within the mysql db.


# Show users defined in the db server currently.


#Close the mysql terminal.


# Setup secure installation of MariaDB.
# No root password for root so 'Enter' for first question,
# Then set root password: 'root1234' and yes 'y' to all remaining ones.


# Show that you can not log into mysql terminal without password anymore.


#Connect to the MariaDB Server and open MySQL CLI with root user and password (pw:root1234).

# Create new database named 'clarusdb'.


# Show newly created database.


# Create a user named 'clarus_user'.
